 Titanic Survival Prediction – Improved Model Accuracy
 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.
It was developed as part of a Data Science traineeship project where the goal was to improve model accuracy through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning)

XGBoost (advanced modeling)

 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Filled missing values (Age, Fare) using median

Dropped uninformative columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)

Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)

Feature Engineering

Created FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1

Created IsAlone feature

Baseline Model

Logistic Regression (~75–78% accuracy)

Model Comparison

Random Forest (~80–85% accuracy)

XGBoost (~82–86% accuracy)

Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimized Random Forest parameters → achieved up to ~88% accuracy

 Visualizations

Survival by Gender

Survival by Passenger Class

Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors

Correlation heatmap

Feature importance (Random Forest / XGBoost)

 Results
Model	Accuracy (approx.)
Logistic Regression	75–78%
Random Forest	80–85%
XGBoost	82–86%
Tuned Random Forest	85–88%

 Accuracy improved significantly from baseline Logistic Regression to tuned Random Forest/XGBoost.
